# Signal Copilot â€“ Lite: Project Overview

## Executive Summary

**Signal Copilot â€“ Lite** is a personalized financial news filtering system that converts market noise into actionable impact alerts. Built with ASP.NET Core 8.0 and Next.js 15, it helps investors focus on news that truly matters to their specific portfolio holdings.

**Status:** Active Development (Phase 4B - Portfolio Analytics)
**Started:** October 15, 2025
**Technology Stack:** ASP.NET Core 8.0, Next.js 15.5.5, PostgreSQL, Hangfire

## Core Problem & Solution

### The Problem
Investors are overwhelmed by thousands of daily headlines but lack tools to filter what's actually relevant to their specific holdings. Generic news feeds don't account for:
- Personal portfolio composition
- Position sizes and exposure
- Individual risk tolerance
- Holding timeframes and investment intent

### The Solution
Signal Copilot analyzes every news article and calculates a personalized **Impact Score** for each user:

```
Impact Score = Sentiment Ã— Magnitude Ã— Confidence Ã— Exposure Ã— ConcentrationMultiplier
```

Where:
- **Sentiment**: -1 (negative), 0 (neutral), 1 (positive)
- **Magnitude**: 1-3 based on event severity
- **Confidence**: 0.0-1.0 from source quality and consensus
- **Exposure**: 0.0-1.0 representing portfolio weight
- **ConcentrationMultiplier**: 1.2x for positions over 15%

This formula ensures users only see news that matters to their specific situation.

## Key Features

### 1. Portfolio Management
- Add/edit/delete holdings with ticker, shares, cost basis
- Track holding intent (Trade, Accumulate, Income, Hold)
- Portfolio image upload with AI ticker extraction
- Fractional share support (up to 8 decimal places)

### 2. News Aggregation
- Multi-source ingestion (NewsAPI, Finnhub, SEC Edgar)
- Automatic deduplication via clustering
- Source quality tiers (Premium, Standard, Social, Official)
- Event categorization (13 predefined categories)

### 3. Sentiment Analysis
- Finance-aware keyword dictionaries
- Rumor detection and confidence adjustment
- Magnitude scoring (1=minor, 2=moderate, 3=major)
- Multi-source consensus calculation

### 4. Impact Scoring
- Personalized per-user calculations
- Concentration risk weighting
- Exposure-based relevance
- Historical analog patterns

### 5. Portfolio Analytics
- Concentration index (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index)
- Intent-based allocation breakdown
- Top position analysis
- Risk profile integration

### 6. Smart Alerts
- Daily digests (configurable time)
- High-impact notifications (threshold-based)
- Email delivery via SendGrid
- Alert status tracking

## Project Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Awareness Tool, Not Financial Advice** - Clearly labeled, provides insights not recommendations
2. **Filter Unverified Headlines** - Rumor detection, source validation, consensus checking
3. **Minimal Personal Data** - Only essential portfolio information
4. **Privacy First** - No social data, no behavior tracking beyond usage

### Out of Scope (v1)
- Trading execution
- Social media scraping
- Paid research feeds
- Alpha predictions
- Broker API integration
